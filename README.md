## Concept
Our objective is to develop a machine learning framework adept at recognizing and classifying characters from diverse alphabets, subsequently identifying the associated language. By employing a convolutional neural network, the system will be trained on a comprehensive dataset of written characters, striving for proficient classification that can accurately discern the alphabet and language. Furthermore, the framework will encompass a component capable of analyzing words, where it leverages the certainty levels of individual character classifications, along with contextual cues like word length and dictionary references, to ascertain the language, and thus the individual characters, of the entire word.
