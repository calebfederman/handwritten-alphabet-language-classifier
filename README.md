## Concept
Compile several languages, classify handwriting/typing by language (get probability for each letter for each class (i.e. what probability it is of each letter and what language that letter is from)), support classification by using a known list of words from each language to differentiate (can use this to try to differentiate between similar language (in terms of characters) such as English and Spanish).
