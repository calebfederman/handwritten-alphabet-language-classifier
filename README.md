# Playing Card Classifier
## Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (CS539 UW-Madison)

## Overview
Our goal is to engineer a machine learning framework capable of recognizing and categorizing playing cards from images, under varying lighting and orientation conditions. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, the system will be trained on a diverse dataset of card images, aiming for a robust classification performance that can discern card rank and suit accurately regardless of the card's position and lighting variances.
